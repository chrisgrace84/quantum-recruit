===============

Sample code for Quantum Recruit database-driven website. 

Quantum Recruit are a new start up recruitment agency, specialising in construction recruitment. They needed a website to give them a professional presence online, as well as added functionality to allow them to manage and update it properly.
The new website was branded and designed with jobs board functionality in mind and the use of a content management system was needed to allow them to manage content and the navigation menu. I created a job import system so their vacancies are uploaded from their internal database system. 
The back end of the website is nearly complete with only a few improvements left to be made. I am currently finalising the front end while the client is preparing all content. A testing application is live from http://www.thisisolivergrace.com/quantum/ and we hope to get the final website live by mid-July.
